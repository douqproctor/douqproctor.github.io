<p><u>What:</u> We already have our wedding bling and a year of marriage under our belts, so this event will not be your traditional wedding. Instead, this celebration will be a chance to raise our glasses with our closest friends and family to celebrate our union. We'll kick off the night with a renewal of vows, followed by cocktails, a sitdown dinner banquet and an after-dinner stroll through the 3 million+ lights that the Gardens hang each winter (though this year, we like to think it's just for us). After dinner, we'll head over to the nearby White family residence for an afterparty. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p><u> What to do in Denver:</u> If you have extra time during your stay, we recommend checking out the Clyfford Still Museum (Katie and Doug's favorite art museum in Denver), take a walk around Cheesman or Washington Park (weather permitting), and snag a breakfast burrito at Onefold (also great for lunch!). </p>

<p><u> Friday & Sunday:</u> We'll be organizing laid back welcome drinks Friday evening and a farewell breakfast on Sunday for anyone in town. Details to follow.
